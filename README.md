Conquest is a large-scale, abstract wargame in the vein of many games that have gone before it.  In particular, it bears a strong resemblance to a game known as "Empire" that has been around in one form or another for decades.

Conquest falls into the category of what is known as a â€œTriple-E" game - Explore, Expand, Exterminate.  You win by destroying your opponent(s) and you do this by building a production base large enough to build a force sufficient for the task.

The game is played on a randomly-generated map that includes terrain types of water, plains, swamp, forest, and mountains.  Scattered about the map are a number of cities; capturing cities is the essence of the game.  Each player starts with a single city from which he begins his conquest. 

I wrote the first version of the game in C++ in the mid-90s, then wrote it over in Java around 2000.  I dusted it off in the fall of 2019 and made some enhancements, and plan to continue development.
