To Test:
- attacking enemy cities
- attacking occupied cities
- ships attacking land units

Bugs:
- CAN BOMB NEUTRAL CITIES. Also, msg was from 'Brenda', not 'Host'.
- Units sometimes drawn in production mode.
- pathfinding problems:
  - favor direct over diagonal moves
- Move-Tos: make move-to delegation recursive- so multiple units don't keep getting stuck
  on each other.
- Make Next Unit start from current unit position.
- Add another Unit command that causes it to execute its MoveTo.

Todo:
- combat explosions
- redo all images
